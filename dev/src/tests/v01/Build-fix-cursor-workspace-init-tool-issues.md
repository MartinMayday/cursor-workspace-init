Please read and implement the plan located at:
/Volumes/uss/cloudworkspace/0_operator/1_Inbox/taskholder/th_cursor-workspace-init/.cursor/plans/fix_cursor_workspace_init_tool_issues_c9db0acb.plan.md

A detailed conversation starter with context, requirements, and execution instructions has been prepared at:
/Volumes/uss/cloudworkspace/0_operator/1_Inbox/taskholder/th_cursor-workspace-init/dev/src/tests/v01/CONVERSATION_STARTER.md



The tool currently fails to generate functional, tailored Cursor workspace files. Testing revealed 10 critical issues that need to be fixed across 10 implementation phases.

Key goal: Generate functional, project-specific Cursor workspace files that provide a strong foundation for Cursor IDE usage without requiring users to learn Cursor documentation first.

Start with Phase 1: Enhanced Context Extraction, then proceed through phases in order as specified in the plan.
